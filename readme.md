Imagine we are doing a new ad campaign where we'll print out a bunch of different Ads for different dresses. The marketing department needs to put something short and sweet on each ad, each with a different dress.

They bought the new domain "rtr.co" and they need something easier to enter on your phone than:
https://www.renttherunway.com/shop/designers/mark__james_by_badgley_mischka/cheetah_crawl_dress

We need to build something on that domain that will redirect users, and ideally, help us track analytics about how each ad is performing.
